## The EZRegex class
Everything relies on the EZRegex class. The EZRegex class is an abstract class, and each dialect subclasses the EZRegex class to define their own elements specific to that dialect (more on that later). Each element represents a fundamental part of the Regular Expression syntax for that language, as well as less-fundemental common combinations for convenience (like email and float).

EZRegex can accept a string or a function to define how it's supposed to interact with the current "chain" of elements. If it's a string, it just adds it to the end. If it's a function, it can accept any positional or named parameters, but has to accept `cur=...` as the last parameter (it's complicated). The `cur` parameter is the currently compiled regular expression chain, as a string. What's returned becomes the new `cur` parameter of the next element, or, if there is no next element, the final regex. That way you can add to the front or back of an expression, and you can change what exactly gets added to the current expression based on other parameters.

The EZRegex class has operators overloaded so you can combine them in intuitive ways and call them by intuitive names.

The EZRegex class, and it's subclasses are immutible, and should not be instantiated directly.

## Typing & Linting
The updated method of doing this is to define all the EZRegex elements of a dialect in `elements.py`, and then add type hints and doc strings in the `elements.pyi` file. EZRegex elements that accept parameters are typed as functions (even though they're not), mostly for convenience for the user when using linters. EZRegex elements that don't accept parameters should be typed as EZRegex, and given documentation as a string on the line below it.

## Dialects
<!-- TODO: rewrite this paragraph -->
*This is being reevaluated*
Because most regex dialects *are* 90% identical, a parent EZRegex class implements most of the applicable logic, and a hidden "base" dialect is implemented, but works a bit differently. It has an `elements.py` file, but it defines all the elements as a dict in the form of {"element_name": {"keyword": "arguements"}}. It then has a `load_dialect()` function, which is the only thing importable from it. The reason it's done this way is because most elements, though identical in different dialects, have to be the appropriate dialect subclass. `load_dialect()` takes the dialect type as a parameter, and instantiates the base elements from it's dict and returns a new dict of initialized elements to be dumped into the global scope of the dialect. The `elements.py` file of a specific dialect can then remove any elements that it doesn't support (using the `del` keyword) and add/overwrite any it does support, or that work differently.

Each subclass of EZRegex must implement a few options to describe the dialect-specific behavior of the EZRegex class, for example, in the JavaScript dialect, /'s are added to the beginning and end of the pattern, and flags are handled differently in each dialect. This has to be implemented directly into the EZRegex subclass.

There's 2 parts that are required:
- `_flag_func`
    - An abstract function that gets called with `final`, which is the final compiled pattern *with* `beginning` and `end` attached, and `flags`, which is a string of all the flags applied to the pattern. Internally, the flags are single digits, because flags usually are. They get passed to this function as a single string, which can be parsed and modified if necissary (it usually isn't)
- `_escape_chars`
    - The characters that need to be escaped. Should be a byte string (i.e. b'...')
- `_final_func`
    - An optional function which takes in the final string about to be returned, and returns the *final* string. Useful for some dialects, for example, in JS adding `/` to the beginning and end of the final pattern

## Inverting
There's actually 2 algorithms implemented for "inverting" regexs. The old algorithm regexs the regexs in a specific order to replace parts one at a time. This is just as nasty and horrifying as it sounds. Dispite it being a terrible, *terrible* solution, I actually got it to work decently well.

Later, when I was reading up on abstract syntax trees, and scrolling around on PyPi, I realized that Python has one built in, and that it's available to use. I reimplemented the whole algorithm to instead parse the AST given by the built-in re lexer, and wrote my own parser on top of it, which works *much* better.

Along the way, I also discovered, deep in the corners of the internet, 2 other Python libraries which do almost the same thing: `xeger` (regex backwards), and `sre_yield`. `xeger` technically works, however it tends to include unprintable characters, so it's output isn't very readable. `sre_yeild` is better, but it can be very slow, and is not quite the use case I'm going for. My invert algorithm is meant to be a debugging tool (though it doubles well for a testing tool), so it does things like detecting words (as opposed to seperate word characters) and inserts actual words, and doing the same for numbers and inserting `12345...`, as well as a couple other enhancements.

## Tests
Tests are run using GitHub Actions, and are run in a Docker container. The Dockerfile is in the `tests` directory, and the manager script is in the same directory. The manager script is run using `bash manager.sh`

How it works:
1. The docker container is built, either locally, or by GitHub Actions
2. The manager script is run inside the docker container, given the arguments passed to the docker run command
3. The manager script runs the appropriate tests
    * For dialect tests, because the regexs in regexs.jsonc are EZRegexs, not regular expression strings, the file needs to be "compiled" by python in order to be used by other languages, before running individual test runner scripts. This is handled by the `compile_regexs.py` script, which is called by the manager script when appropriate.
    * Each dialect has its own test runner script, which is run by the manager script. These are written in their appropriate language.

Commands:
* To build locally:
    * `docker build -f ./tests/Dockerfile -t ezregex-test .`
* To force rebuild locally:
    * `docker build -f ./tests/Dockerfile -t ezregex-test --no-cache .`
* To run tests locally:
    * `docker run -v "$(pwd)":/app ezregex-test <args>` to sync the project files
    * `docker run ezregex-test <args>`
* To run tests locally with a specific test:
    * `docker run -v "$(pwd)":/app ezregex-test <invert | generate | all | most | dialect <dialect>>`
    * dialect accepts `py | js | r | pcre | all`

* If one of the dialect runners *fails*, it could be just a problem with the regexs.jsonc file.
* If one of the dialect runners *errors*, you're probably allowing compilation of a regex that the dialect doesn't support. That means it's a problem with the code itself, and the regexs.jsonc file has innaccurate dialects specified.
* If the compile_regexs.py script fails, it's probably a problem with the regexs.jsonc file trying to use a feature of a dialect that it doesn't support (innaccurate dialects).

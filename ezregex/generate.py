        You give the function a set of things you want an expression to match (`winners`), and a set
        of things you want it not to match (`losers`), and it generates an expression that does so.

        `calls` sets the max number of iterations of the algorithm we do before we give up and return
        what we have
        `restarts` sets how many times we restart to algorithm in order to shake things up in case we've
        gone down a sub-optimal path
        `max_len` sets the maximum length of induvidual chunks that we OR together

        The algorithm runs for `calls` * `restarts` times, so tread lightly when setting those values.
        Increasing them causes the algorithm to run longer and find a shorter regex that meets the
        specifications, but it will also be significantly slower.
